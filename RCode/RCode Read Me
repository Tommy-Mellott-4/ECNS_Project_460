Some of the R Code is not made directly by us. 

We first use Run0, code provided by Dr. Atwood, to establish a working directory. Other Code of his we dont use much include Run1, Run2, and Misc_Functions

In order, to get to the point we are now, run: 

Download_Specific_AiportData.R

my_GHCN_functions.R

OrganizeSpecificData.R

Tables Work - 460 Project.R

----

We based this primarily on these two datasets

station_info/WORLD-TEMP-Stations-1900-2024.RData

 station_info/ghcnd-stations.RData
